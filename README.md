# MIMIC-IV v3.1 Database

This project is based on the **MIMIC-IV v3.1** dataset, a large-scale, publicly available electronic health record (EHR) database developed by the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology.

### What is MIMIC-IV?
- **MIMIC (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care)** is a comprehensive EHR dataset containing de-identified data from **over 300,000 ICU and hospital admissions** at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
- **Version 4 (MIMIC-IV)** separates hospital-level and ICU-level data for cleaner integration and research.
- **v3.1** is the latest stable release as of this repository, with expanded coverage and fixed inconsistencies from prior versions.

# This repository contains:

This repository contains a sequence of Jupyter notebooks designed to build an AKI prediction pipeline using MIMIC-IV data. The notebooks should be running in the following order:

1. **`cohort.ipynb`**  
   Selects eligible ICU stays and constructs the AKI cohort.

3. **`vital.ipynb`**  
   Extracts and preprocesses vital sign features (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, temperature).

4. **`lab.ipynb`**  
   Extracts laboratory test results and treatment information, and computes derived features (e.g., bun, antibiotics, vasopressor).

5. **`data.ipynb`**  
   Merges cohort, vital, and lab data into a final modeling dataset.

6. **`train.ipynb`**  
   Trains and evaluates the AKI prediction model using the processed dataset.

> - Provide reproducible cohort split IDs (`splits_stay.pt`) that allow researchers to regenerate the same cohorts.  
> - **High memory usage** during notebook execution (especially during data merge and modeling).
> - **PostgreSQL database** with **MIMIC-IV v3.1** tables **fully registered and indexed**.

# Dataset Version & Reproducibility

This repository contains the official, fully updated implementation built on MIMIC‑IV v3.1.

* Version migration.  
  -The study was originally prototyped on MIMIC‑IV v2.0 and re‑run on v3.1 during peer‑review.  
  -The analytic pipeline (feature engineering, splitting strategy, evaluation) is unchanged, but patient‑level membership inevitably differs because the two releases do not contain identical records.

* Why the cohorts diverge.  
  -A subset of patients used for the temporal validation split appears only in v3.1. They were initially treated as 2020‑2022 admissions; later inspection showed that some are simply newly published records and not strictly time‑delimited.

* Impact on results.  
  - Main experiments & ablation studies: fully reproduced on v3.1 and unaffected by the version change.  
  - Temporal validation in the Appendix: cohort shift means the exact numbers in the paper cannot be recreated. Interpret those figures with caution; they are illustrative, not central to the conclusions.

> Author‑endorsed codebase. Use this repository for any replication or extension—every primary result has been verified under MIMIC‑IV v3.1.  
> Caveat. Only the Appendix’s temporal‑validation metrics are version‑sensitive and are not directly comparable to the headline results.
